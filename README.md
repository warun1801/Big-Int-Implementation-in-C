# Big-Int-Implementation-in-C
Representing and processing on large integers in languages that do not have in built support for it like C. It is a linked-list implementation for dynamic allocation. 
It has for now just Addition,Multiplication and Subtraction capabilities.But it can do it for however long integers you need.
It is more space efficient than the "string" implementation.
